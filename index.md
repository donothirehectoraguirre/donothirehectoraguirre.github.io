## DON'T HIRE HECTOR

DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER!

### MY EXPERIENCE

Hector treated me so poorly that I created this website to warn others to avoid this man.

After days of Hector's bullying, I asked him to leave my house and he refused. I told him I would call the police if he did not leave my house and started to record.

Hector is the kind of person that will demand money for incomplete and poorly done work.

Hector will gaslight you and tell you are "making a big deal out of nothing" after refusing to leave your home.

Hector is so dillusional that he called the police to "report me" for not wanting to pay him.

The police came to my house and removed this man from my property.

Hector left **literal** human feces at my home because he is a disgusting person.

### UNLICENCSED

Hector works without a valid California Contractors license which is a misdemeanor.

Learn from my mistake! Always (check the license)[https://www.cslb.ca.gov/onlineservices/checklicenseII/checklicense.aspx] and NEVER hire an unlicensed contractor! You will regret it like I do.

Hector will give you a sob story about how he lost everything and drive to the job in a beat up 1987 Toyota truck. When he wants "his money" he will drive up with his wifey in a late model Lexus SUV. 

### BAD BUSINESS

Hector will quote you a low price and then the gaslighting will immediate start.

Do not pay this man cash! He will tell you he doesn't have a bank account and bring you receipts paid for with his visa card.

He will ask to increase the price.

He won't pay for materials and will try to give you receipts.

He will try to change the price.

He will not take no for an answer. He will bully you and gaslight until you either give up or fire him.

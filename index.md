## DON'T HIRE THIS MAN

Hector is nasty, gaslighting bully that will do a bad job and still try to overcharge you.

Do not pay this man cash! He will tell you he doesn't have a bank account and bring you receipts paid for with his visa card.

### Bully

Hector treate me so poorly that I asked him to leave and he refused. I told him I would call the police if he did not leave my house.

See for yourself what type of person you are inviting into your home.

Hector will gaslight you and tell you are "making a big deal out of nothing" after refusing to leave your home.
